#1. Write Python code that prints your name, student number and email address.
# name=input("ENTER YOUR NAME:")
# stu_num=input("ENTER YOUR STUDENT NUMBER:")
# email=input("ENTER YOUR EMAIL:")
# print("NAME: ",name)
# print("STUDENT NUMBER: ",stu_num)
# print("EMAIL: ",email)

#2. Write Python code that prints your name, student number and email address using escape sequences.
# name=input("ENTER YOUR NAME:")
# stu_num=input("ENTER YOUR STUDENT NUMBER:")
# email=input("ENTER YOUR EMAIL:")
# print("Name: ",name,"\nStudent Number: ",stu_num,"\nEmail: ",email)

#3. Write Python code that add, subtract, multiply and divide the two numbers. You can use the two numbers 14 and 7
# num1=14
# num2=7
# print("Addition(14+7): ",num1+num2)
# print("Product(14*7): ",num1*num2)
# print("Subtraction(14-7): ",num1-num2)
# print("Division(14/7): ",num1/num2)

#4. Write Python code that displays the numbers from 1 to 5 as steps.
# print("1","\n2","\n3","\n4","\n5")

#5. Write Python code that outputs the following sentence (including the quotation marks and line break) to the screen:
# "SDK" stands for "Software Development Kit", whereas "IDE" stands for "Integrated Development Environment"
# print("\"SDK\" stands for \"Software Development Kit\", whereas \"IDE\" stands for \"Integrated Development Environment\"")

#6.  6 Practice and check the output
# print("python is an \"awesome\" language.")
# print("python\n\t2023")
# print('I\'m from Entri.\b')
# print("\65")
# print("\x65")
# print("Entri", "2023", sep="\n")
# print("Entri", "2023", sep="\b")
# print("Entri", "2023", sep="*", end="\b\b\b\b")

#7. Define the variables below. Print the types of each variable. What is the sum of your variables?
# (Hint: use a type conversion function.) What datatype is the sum?
# num = 23
# textnum = "57"
# decimal = 98.3
# print(type(num),type(textnum),type(decimal))
# textnum2=int(textnum)
# sum=num+textnum2+decimal
# print("23+57+98.3 = ",sum)

#8. calculate the number of minutes in a year using variables for each unit of time.
# print a statement that describes what your code does also.
# nod=365
# hours=24
# minutes=60
# min_in_year=nod*hours*minutes
# print("Number of minutes in an an year: ",min_in_year)
# print("This code takes three variables to store \"no of days in an year\", \"minute in a hour\", \"hours in a day\", "
#       "\nthen calculates the total minutes in an year by multiplying these 3 variables")

#9. Write Python code that asks the user to enter his/her name and then output/prints his/her name with a greeting.
# name=input("Please enter your name: ")
# print("Hi {}, welcome to Python programming :)".format(name))
